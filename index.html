                <p>Last night, I took a break from writing and watched a TV program on the history of a young man named <strong>Alexander Graham Bell</strong>. Bell had just patented his telephone and was having growing pains because the demand for his new invention was so strong.</p>
                
                <p>Needing a bigger company, he then went to the giant at that time, <strong>Western Union</strong>, and asked them if they would buy his patent and his tiny company. He wanted $100,000 for the whole package. The president of Western Union scoffed at him and turned him down, saying the price was ridiculous.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"The rest is history. A multi-billion-dollar industry emerged, and AT&T was born."</p>

                <p>A terminated manager of about 45 years of age had his wife and two babies at the plant and was begging the guards to let him talk to the owners to ask if they would reconsider his termination. He had just bought a house and was afraid of losing it.</p>
                
                <p>The camera focused in on his pleading for all the world to see. Needless to say, it held my attention.</p>
